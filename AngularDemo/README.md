The repository for the [Medium tutorial](https://medium.com/@d_thompson6/angular-video-conferencing-with-agora-io-45905235eebb) on integrating [Agora.io's JS SDK](https://docs.agora.io/en/Video/API%20Reference/web/index.html) with Angular using the [ngx-agora library](https://github.com/drew-thompson/ngx-agora).

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.9.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
